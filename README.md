Hypermegacube
=============

[Calculates dimensions](src/Main.java) (in servers) of perfect cubes in varying sizes made of [19-inch rack servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit). 

This is the underpinning of the Hypermegacube project, intended to provide every child in the world with their own emulated Nintendo Gamecube console, hosted on an emulator inside a huge, monumental structure made of commodity server equipment. 

* This assumes that all servers are square (19 x 19 inches) and does not account for cooling. Your cubage may vary. If you do not keep up repayments on your cube your cube may be repossessed.
